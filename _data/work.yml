    At MITRE, I worked with the MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations team to develop and improve malware used in past and upcoming rounds of evaluations.  
    One project involved updating a Linux backdoor.  
    This consisted of adding a handler to a C2 framework, updating the implant to be persistent and user configurable, creating and evaluating custom ethernet packets using Wireshark, and analyzing an example malware sample using Ghidra.  
    Additionally, I sat in on a cyber exercise which evaluated deception technologies, and placed third in an intern embedded systems capture the flag competition.

    On Google Cloud’s Event Threat Detection Team, I initially worked on building customer-configurable detection modules to identify IAM-based privilege escalation attacks.  
    After finishing the project two months early, I picked up a project that would allow security engineers to run YARA-L and SQL rules against Google Cloud Platform logs in real time.  
    I specifically worked on parsing log data out into a table so commands could be run against them.  
    As of now, the custom module code is in production.

    On Google Ad’s Cross Media Measurement Team, I collaborated with Facebook, Amazon, and other companies to measure ad views across various media platforms to provide users with more diverse ads and advertising companies with more accurate data.   
    I specifically worked on securing user data. 
    This involved building a library to encrypt identifier-payload pairs for a Panel Match Batch Lookup Workflow.  
    Encryption consisted of methods such as AES, HKDF, SHA256, and Deterministic Commutative Encryption. As of now, the code is in production.
