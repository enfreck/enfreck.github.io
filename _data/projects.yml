    The FoRTE lab focuses on research that challenges the intersection of hardware and software.  
    With a focus in security, systems, and architecture, the lab is known for its work in fuzzing.  
    Under the direction of Dr. Matthew Hicks, the research I conduct with this lab centers around how hardware can be fuzzed more efficiently and with better coverage.  
    Specifically, I will be working on a better implementation for fuzzing processors.

    The IT Security Office is the office that oversees Virginia Tech’s technology, services, and security.   
    For the last two years, I have worked with the ITSO, under the direction of Randy Marchany, to develop a website that provides researchers, faculty, and other users a simple way to figure out where to best store their data securely.  
    Now, I am writing simple and clear procedures for individuals to follow to increase Virginia Tech’s cyber defenses from CIS Control IG1 to IG2.
