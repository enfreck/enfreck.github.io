### Hi, I'm Erin Freck
I am a graduate student in the FoRTE and ITSO labs at Virginia Tech.  I recently graduated Summa Cum Laude with a B.S. Computer Engineering also from Virginia Tech.  In an effort to pursue my passion for cybersecurity, I decided to continue my education to get a M.S. Computer Science with a certificate in Cybersecurity.  My journey started on the blue team side of things, but my interests have taken me towards red team work.  Specifically, I am passionate about offensive non-kinetics and vulnerability research.
